Overall psuedocode

first I need to generate the signal
then I need to have an array for my signal 

then I need an array for the FIR filter vector coefficients 

then I i put the samples into a buffer 

thenn I take the individual samples from the buffer and pass each one through the filter

when i pass the sample through the filter I'm multiplying the sample by each coefficient 
one at a time the output of each multiplication is a coefficient that has been filtered. 

so I need three arrays 
h is the coefficient array
signal_input is the generated signal 
signal_output is the filtered signal
